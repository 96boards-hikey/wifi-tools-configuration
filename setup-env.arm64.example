# patches under the patches directory:
# - patches under the pathces/driver_patches/$KERNEL_VARIANT directory would be
#   applied during "modules" build.
# - patches under the patches/kernel_patches/$/$KERNEL_VARIANT directory would
#   be applied to the kernel pointed by KERNEL_PATH in case the "patch_kernel"
#   command is used.
#   Note: the kernel is not built automatically after the patches are applied
